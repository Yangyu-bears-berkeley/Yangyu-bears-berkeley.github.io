  <p><b> 2019-present: Market mechanism design for the integration of renewables and energy storage techniques in energy systems context</b>, supported by Building Efficiency and Sustainability in the Tropics 2 (NRF of Singapore, headed by <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/spanos.html">Prof. Costas J. Spanos</a>) <br />
    </br>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>  <p> IDesigned an optimal and fair sharing mechanism for community energy storage based on coalition
game theory which could facilitate the deployment of capital-intensive energy storage techniques
in energy systems. </p> </li>
      <li> <p> Developed a cloud energy storage model to enable economic penetration of volatile renewable
generation based on non-cooperative game theory, which could work as an example how market
mechanism can shape the efficiency of energy systems.
            </p> </li>
    <li> <p> Design efficient and scalable peer-to-peer energy trading market via coalition formation based on
cooperative and non-cooperative game theory. (in progress) </p> </li>
