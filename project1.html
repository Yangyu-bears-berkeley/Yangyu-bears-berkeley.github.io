<h2>Bring Energy Storage (ES) and Renewable Energy (RE) to Energy Systems via Market Design</h2>
</div>  
  <div>
    
    <h3> Overview</h3>
 <p class="big">  Renewable energy (RE) and energy storage (ES) are two key technologies to advance the world’s transition towards a sustainable, 
   reliable and flexible energy system. Particularly, the feed-in of RE at scale requires ES to offset the temporal imbalance of supply and demand.
   Whereas ES is still expensive, pairing renewable generators with isolated ES to compensate the imbalance will make the shaped renewable 
   supply cost-uncompetitive or even raise the levelized cost above high-carbon alternatives. Therefore, how to pave the way for the integration 
   of ES and RE in energy system has become a critical problem facing our current energy system transition. </p>.
    
    <p class="big">  The manifestation of sharing economy in various realms suggests its potential to bringing in capital-intensive new technologies in energy systems, 
      such as ES. Instead of compelling consumers to install isolated ES which are usually under-utilized and intensive to justify the high capital cost, 
      the ES technologies may be delivered to consumers in a sharing paradigm, thus lowering the economic barriers of commercial deployment. 
      For example, multiple consumers within a community can cooperatively invest and share a central ES;  
      Or a third entity can invest bulks of ES to provide ES service to its customers. Both of the two sharing paradigms are foreseeable in future energy system, 
      whereas their successful exertion relies on well-defined market mechanism (or ES models) to appropriately “allocate” 
      the benefits of ES among the different stakeholders involved.  </b> </p>

  <h3>  Optimal and Fair Sharing of Community Energy Storage </h3>
  <div> <a href="IMGLINKTARGET"><img src="Project1_1.png" alt="alt text" width="500"  height="450" /></a> </div>
 <p class="big"> In this project, we have studied the case where multiple users cooperatively invest a central ES, usually called community energy storage.
   We formulate the communication of the users involved as a coalition game. Through full cooperation, this ES model can maximize the value of ES co-created. 
   However, how to allocate the co-created payoff among the participants is a critical issue to ensure the stability of the coalition. The existing fair cost 
   allocation based on the solution concept of core is computationally intensive as it requires exponential computation to identify the marginal contributions 
   of each peer participants. </p>

<p class="big">  To address such issude, we develop a fair payoff allocation mechanism represented by the nucleolus for the heterogeneous peer participants based 
  on constraints generation technique. The main innovation is that the proposed payoff allocation mechanism can reduce the exponential computation cost to 
  linear thus able to be applied to large cooperation. </p>
  
  <h3> Selling Renewable Utilization Service to Consumers via Cloud Energy Storage </h3>
  <div> <a href="IMGLINKTARGET"><img src="Project1_2.png" alt="alt text" width="570"  height="460" /></a> </div>
  <p class="big">  For the second sharing paradigm that an energy storage operator (ESO) invests blocks of ES resource to gain profit by providing 
    energy storage service to its consumers, we have designed a novel cloud energy storage model (CES). Similar to the cloud computing, 
    a novel CES model by allowing the ESO to sell renewable integration service instead of renting ES capacity to its consumers. 
    The proposed CES model adopts a socio-economic communication framework by allowing both the ESO and its consumers to maximize their monetary value. 
    One innovation is that we designed a quadratic price model for the ESO to charge its consumers by the required renewable integration targets. 
    Differing from most existing CES models sound viable but are not optimistic for application due to the low sharing efficiency, 
    i.e., both the ESO and its consumers can not gain favorable value from the ES sharing market, the proposed CES model admits an equilibrium and demonstrates
    near optimal social benefits (efficiency). Notably, this project can work as an example on how market design can shaping the efficiency of resource sharing 
    in a competitive paradigm.</p>
