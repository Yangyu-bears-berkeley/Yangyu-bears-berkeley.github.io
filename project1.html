<h2>Bring Energy Storage (ES) and Renewable Energy (RE) to Energy Systems via Market Design</h2>
</div>  
  <div>
    
    <h3> Overview</h3>
 <p class="big">  &nbsp; &nbsp; Renewable energy (RE) and energy storage (ES) are two key technologies to advance the world’s transition towards a sustainable, 
   reliable and flexible energy system. Particularly, the feed-in of RE at scale requires ES to offset the temporal imbalance of supply and demand. 
   Whereas ES is still expensive, pairing renewable generators with isolated ES will make the shaped renewable supply cost-uncompetitive, 
   raising the economic barriers for their commercial deployment. 
   The manifestation of sharing economy in various realms reveals its potential to bringing in capital-intensive new technologies in energy systems, such as ES. 
   Instead of compelling consumers to install isolated ES which are usually under-utilized and intensive to justify the high capital cost, the ES technologies 
   may be delivered to consumers in a affordable way through a sharing paradigm like other commodities. 
   For example, multiple consumers within a community can cooperatively invest and share a central ES,  
   Or a third entity can invest bulks of ES to provide ES service to its customers. Both of these sharing paradigms are foreseeable in future energy system, 
   whereas their successful exertion relies on well-defined market mechanism (or ES models) to appropriately “allocate” the benefits of ES among the different 
   stakeholders involved.  </p>
    
    <p class="big">  &nbsp; &nbsp; In this project, we have applied game theory (coalition game and stackelberg game) to address the market design of ES sharing for 
      facilitating renewable integration,   thus paving the way for the energy system transitions. Particularly, these works can work as examples how market design can shape the efficiency of resources 
      in energy systems.  </b> </p>

  <h3>  Optimal and Fair Sharing of Community Energy Storage </h3>
  <div> <a href="IMGLINKTARGET"><img src="Project1_1.png" alt="alt text" width="500"  height="450" /></a> </div>
 <p class="big"> &nbsp; &nbsp; For ES sharing within a community, We proposed an optimal energy storage (ES) sharing model which is cooperatively invested by multiple buildings to 
   harness on-site renewable utilization and grid price arbitrage (referred to community ES sharing). We jointly consider the ES sizing, operation and cost
allocation via a coalition game formulation. Particularly, we study the fair ex-post cost allocation of ES sharing based on
nucleolus by employing a constraint generation technique. We demonstrate the fairness and computational efficiency of the
method through case studies. The numeric results imply the proposed method outperforms Shapley approach and proportional
method in computational efficiency and fairness, respectively. Notably, only a small fraction of characteristic function (less
than 1% for 20 buildings) is computed to achieve cost allocation versus the entire information required by Shapley approach. With
the proposed cost allocation, we demonstrate the enhanced social benefits of the ES sharing model over individual ES (IES) model.
We show the proposed ES sharing model can provide higher cost reduction to each committed building than the IES model, i.e., 8.5% versus 2.3%. Moreover, the average value1
of ES is considerably improved (about 1.83 times) over the IES model. </p>


  
  <h3> Selling Renewable Utilization Service to Consumers via Cloud Energy Storage </h3>
  <div> <a href="IMGLINKTARGET"><img src="Project1_2.png" alt="alt text" width="570"  height="460" /></a> </div>
  <p class="big">  &nbsp; &nbsp; For ES sharing through a third entity, we developed a cloud energy storage (CES) model for enabling local renewable integration of building consumers (BCs). 
    Different from most existing third-party based ES sharing models that the energy storage operator (ESO) gains profit by leasing energy or power capacity, our CES model
allows the ESO to sell renewable utilization service (RUS) to its consumers, i.e., the total amount of local renewable generation shifted to supply their demand. Notably, we propose a quadratic
price model for the ESO charging its consumers by their requested RUS and formulate their interactions as a Stackelberg game, which admits an equilibrium. We prove the CES model 
outperforms individual ES (IES) model in social welfare. Besides, we study the performance of the CES model compared with the IES model and an existing ES sharing model (referring to
VES model) via case studies. We demonstrate the CES model can provide 2-4 times profit to the ESO than the VES model. Meanwhile, higher cost reduction for the BCs are secured by the
CES model. Moreover, we show the CES model can achieve near social optima and high ES efficiency (i.e., utilization) which are not provided by the other ES models.</p>
