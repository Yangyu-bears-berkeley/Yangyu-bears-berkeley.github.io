<h1>Bring Energy Storage (ES) and Renewable Energy (RE) to Energy Systems via Market Design</h1>
</div>  
  <div>
    
    <h2> Project Outline</h2>
 <p class="big">  Energy storage (ES) and renewable energy (RE) are two critical technologies to enable energy system transition. Whereas the high capital cost defers its penetration into energy system. 
    The justification of the ES capital cost relies on well-designed ES business models that can harness the maximum value for the stakeholders involved </p>.
    
    <p class="big">  The prosperity of sharing economy suggests its capability to bring capital-intensive ES resources to energy system through sharing. 
    There are generally two sharing paradigms: i) multiple users cooperatively to invest and use a common-owned ES; 
    ii) An energy storage operator (ESO) invests blocks of ES to gain profit by providing energy storage service to its consumers. 
    The successful exertion of both ES sharing models relies on an appropriate market mechanism to “allocate” the payoff among the different stakeholders involved. 
    This is a nontrivial task due to the multi-step operation patterns of the ES. We have applied coalition game and non-cooperative game theory to address the problems. </b> </p>

  <h2>  Optimal and Fair Sharing of Community Energy Storage </h2>
  <div> <a href="IMGLINKTARGET"><img src="Project1.png" alt="alt text" width="470"  height="450" /></a> </div>
 <p class="big"> In this project, we have studied the case where multiple users cooperatively invest a central ES, usually called community energy storage.
   We formulate the communication of the users involved as a coalition game. Through full cooperation, this ES model can maximize the value of ES co-created. 
   However, how to allocate the co-created payoff among the participants is a critical issue to ensure the stability of the coalition. The existing fair cost 
   allocation based on the solution concept of core is computationally intensive as it requires exponential computation to identify the marginal contributions 
   of each peer participants. </p>

<p class="big">  To address such issude, we develop a fair payoff allocation mechanism represented by the nucleolus for the heterogeneous peer participants based 
  on constraints generation technique. The main innovation is that the proposed payoff allocation mechanism can reduce the exponential computation cost to 
  linear thus able to be applied to large cooperation. </p>
  
  <h2> Selling Renewable Utilization Service to Consumers via Cloud Energy Storage </h2>
  <p class="big">  For the second sharing paradigm that an energy storage operator (ESO) invests blocks of ES resource to gain profit by providing 
    energy storage service to its consumers, we have designed a novel cloud energy storage model (CES). Similar to the cloud computing, 
    a novel CES model by allowing the ESO to sell renewable integration service instead of renting ES capacity to its consumers. 
    The proposed CES model adopts a socio-economic communication framework by allowing both the ESO and its consumers to maximize their monetary value. 
    One innovation is that we designed a quadratic price model for the ESO to charge its consumers by the required renewable integration targets. 
    Differing from most existing CES models sound viable but are not optimistic for application due to the low sharing efficiency, 
    i.e., both the ESO and its consumers can not gain favorable value from the ES sharing market, the proposed CES model admits an equilibrium and demonstrates
    near optimal social benefits (efficiency). Notably, this project can work as an example on how market design can shaping the efficiency of resource sharing 
    in a competitive paradigm.</p>
